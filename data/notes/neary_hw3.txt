==================================== General Notes ===================================

Extraneous code is definitely harder to spot in this problem than I thought that it 
would be. Maybe this problem is too straightforward to really screw up badly?
That makes me think that maybe I should also pull in one of the more complicated 
assignments, there could potentially be more extraneous code the more compicated an
assignment is at face value. 

================================ Specific Assignments ================================


else followed immmediately by if... could consider this extraneous, treat it as a 
misundetstanding of the if-elif-else construct
     - hw3_100.py
     - hw3_107.py


unnecessary cast of input() to str(), input already comes in as a string
     - hw3_102.py

unnecessary else clause, it is unreachable because all possible values are covered
     - hw3_118.py
